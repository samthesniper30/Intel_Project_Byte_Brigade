1,Gigi john,Reviewed in India on 25 March 2024,5,"I bought this i5 11400f in 2023 and still it does its job with no sweat. Well my purpose is editing in premier pro and gaming @1080p resolution. Paired with rtx 3060, its a beast at 1080p. Played competitive games and high graphics intense games like forza horizon 5 etc etc... Does its job fine. A common statement is intel processor's heat better than amd processors, well it is true. It heats very well, stock cooler not enough, my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler. A decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one, it is not unlocked in fact, so no explanation needed i guess. If u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards , please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance. When said all these, i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn't disappointed me. When considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr. Many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so... Yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with it??. Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen. So yeah that's it.",,

For having 6 cores it surprised me how well it performs on FPS games, does better than many 8 Core CPUs . This i5-11400f seems very snappy with Decent frame rates at 1080p and 1440. Maybe a perfect match for an Nvidia 3060 gpu or Radeon 6700 gpu or Maybe an Intel Arc A750 gpu.
