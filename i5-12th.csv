2,James B,Reviewed in Canada on 10 June 2024,5,Most people would probably buy this CPU for gaming but I decided to throw it in my server since it has lots of cores and Intel's best IGPU.Works brilliantly for the price (189.99CAD)The IGPU works wonders for Plex video transcoding.,

It runs cool (64 degrees) during stress tests and gaming, and it is stable to 5.1 GHz. Haven't tried to push it, but have little doubt there is sufficient headroom to OC further. This has turned out to be an outstanding CPU. I recommend this CPU to anyone interested in a low-cost, low-heat, and stable performance.",

17,Zixian,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2023,5,"Got it for £174 from Amazon US, which is about £65 cheaper than buying one in the UK. Even if you compare it with a 13400, which has a similar performance running at base clock, it is still so much cheaper (£46).If I remember correctly, the cpu does not come with a warranty, which is probably fine as CPUs are known to be very durable. So make sure you test it when you receivie it so you know if it's faulty.",

38,Kevin,Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2023,5,"Purchased for $150 for Cyber Monday 2023 and it's been excellent. In Cyberpunk 2077, with Ray Tracing on and a mix of ultra/high settings, I've reached 60-120 FPS (usually hovering between 70-90) with a Gigabyte Eagle 4060. I've hit 500+ FPS in League of Legends, and with V-Sync on, I've had no noticeable drop from 165 FPS. On sale, this is an excellent processor and an INCREDIBLE upgrade from my previous 9400f which was and still is a very capable processor. Temps are very stable with a Peerless Assassin cooler; I don't believe I've reached or exceeded 60 degrees Celsius. I haven't overclocked yet - if I even will, because current performance is excellent - but I've read that this processor overclocks a fair amount.",

47,Sho'Nuff,Reviewed in the United States on 12 November 2023,5,"Decided to finally upgrade from my 6 or 7 year old Asus X99 platform and 980ti sli (yes that old) to an Asus Tuf Z790/12600k/Tuf 4080 OC gamers edition. My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. Again, I highly recommend this processor. Can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick.",

I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process.

91,Sang Kim,Reviewed in the United States on 12 April 2023,3,Bought the i5 because it was on sale and unfortunately I could not get the system to boot. I made sure to update the bios on my motherboard and did the usual trouble shooting with various components. It was difficult to try to talk with tech support from Gigabyte but after troubleshooting and going back and forth for about a week and a half we had zero success. Ordered an i7 from Amazon and everything works very well I’m happy to say. 12th Gen intel CPU’s are a great bargin!,

93,Ronald T. baker,Reviewed in the United States on 13 November 2021,3,"UserBenchmark favors intel for some reason.They would have you believe the 12600k is around 20% better than the 5600x, but watch CPU reviews on Youtube and you'll see individual gaming benchmarks puts them at the same performance but with the 5600x using half the power consumption.Additionally, the motherboards for the 12600k can cost over twice as much as that of the 5600x ones.It basically just makes more sense to go with the 5600x at the time of this review, because both CPUs are the same price of $300.The 12600k is not a bad CPU, it's just that the 5600x is considerably more affordable and efficient for the same performance as the 12600k.",

101,Joshua J. Dixon,Reviewed in the United States on 11 August 2022,2,"I purchased this processor and was happy with it until I stumbled upon a youtube video that proclaimed that most memory doesn't run at it's max speed. My DDR5 memory did just that - it ran at 4000 instead of it's 5200 (and it is certified to run on this processor). In my motherboard's BIOS, I adjusted the memory to run at 5200 with XMP-1 (an ASUS setting). It crashed a lot, so I tried their XMP-2 setting and everything froze up. Next thing I knew, nothing worked! I bought new memory, a new motherboard and eventually a new processor. When I found out this processor was the part that went bad (and it has a 3 year warranty), I submitted a ticket to Intel and they concluded that I ""overclocked"" the processor by pushing the memory to 5200 and they sent me to their webpage that specified this processor has a 4800 limit. Since then, I looked at every page before the one they sent me and none of them said anything about the 4800 memory speed limit.If setting memory speed a little over 4800 will fry your processor, shouldn't there be warnings everywhere and in every step of your tweaking? I now have a fried processor sitting on my desk and who is to blame? Is it me for trying to get the best performance out of my hardware and never seeing any warnings about this? Or maybe for Intel for their XMP standard that doesn't give you any warnings - especially since this is their standard that they created.I give this processor 2 stars - 5 for performance, but 0 for getting my fried processor and blaming me for ignorance of technicalities that are not upfront and lack of a warning system that they could have and should have implemented to prevent such catastrophes.",

109,Brian,Reviewed in the United States on 23 January 2022,1,"No support for deepcool heatsinks, wasted time modifying it to fit, (it does work, but wasted a couple hours on a process that should take 5-10 minutes). I have never had so much trouble get a cpu to run in linux. Good grief, I’m a computer expert by trade, and intel should have waited to release this series. I know the competition is tough, but I definitely wont go and buy another one of these. I thought it would be a good investment. I may have damage my motherboard on install, as the cpu slip out of my hands and banged up against the socket bent some pins. It was so hard to get running under linux, graphics support is nonexistent, i can only the XE2 new graphics cards will be more of the same since these are based on that Technology. You can find a work around on Phoronix for the graphics problem, however the image on linux sucks it’s more pixelated than i would like. I would like to mention I needed to my rx 580 to get this thing running as the Linux OS didn’t recognize the GFX chip on the cpu. And with the way the situation is with gpu’s I’m lucky to have had one at hand. The Bios also doesn’t show on my pc correctly if you use the onboard Intel graphics, its cutoff . Also the hard drive was not recognized with the motherboard but it happed two motherboard asrock and gigabyte. I had to install a new elilo version to get the efi to work. What can i say the performance is good, but runs hot 120 watts at the cpu when doing multithreaded task like compiling the kernel. It does that fast but Ryzen 12 core does it faster and with less power 95watts. It’s hard to say this was an upgrade, my head hurts whenever an issue comes up with this cpu. Now after about month of use the gfx is acting weird, it starts to fragment / pixelated and gets stuck. I’m sure intel knows and I probably should have just gotten a kf series instead because it is so bad now i just left the dang rx 580 in the system. Maybe I’m not the only one, I’m sure a class action lawsuit is in the works. I have not been able to enjoy this since I purchased on day one. I would have returned this but then I would have to return the motherboard to another vendor and i sure don’t want to go to that trouble. I fortunately got ddr4 version so I reduced the amount of ram in the computer and will use it as is until it dies. Hopefully after this crypto boom I’ll be able to snag a ryzen 5th gen combo for cheap. My intel can fix this but it will be years before this happens. They are too busy playing catch up. The power efficiency is terrible and the whole experience is about as bad as it gets. Save yourself a headache and get something comparable like a 3700x or better. This is not worth the price or painful install procedures. I just thought it was ridiculous coming from intel, didnt they create the PCs we know of today??? Did i mention the bios was cuttoff on left and right edges so you cant read the functions??? I’m surprised Intel engineers released this, more of a sample than a final product. Buy something else, did i mention the cheapest motherboard sets you back around $200, so $500 into this ordeal is not a good experience, could have purchased 2 sets of used ryzen 7 8 core cpus and motherboard for the same money and ultimately gotten more performance in power usage and cpu. That’s my thoughts on this product.",
110,AaronBalck21,Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2023,1,"So I ordered this 12600K as it was for sale on BF, when I recieved order, I started to install it on my MB(MS? B660M MORTAR WIFI DDR4). Insalation went without any problem, but when I tried to turn it on, CPU light on MB turned red, then DRAM lights turned yellow, it cycled like this for 3-4 times and then it went to DRAM lights yellow only. I tried to swap RAM, BIOS flash, reset, tried to to plug out and in CPU pin connectors and etc. It just didn't worked, but it wasn't main problem, when I tried to pu my old cpu(12400) back to MB it didn't turned on also, say?n same problems. I took my PC to service, there was no damage to any hardware, including MB pins. Somehow your faulty 12600K did shenanigans on my MB so service had to, as much as I understand BIOS reset or flash my MB again for my old CPU to work. Extremely disappointed.
