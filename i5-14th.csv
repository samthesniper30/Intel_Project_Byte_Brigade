5,Rdawg,Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2024,5,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."

8,J,Reviewed in Japan on 7 January 2024,5,Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
9,B Allan,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 June 2024,5,"Perfect CPU, fast and reliable.Fast delivery"
10,Shadowbat,Reviewed in Mexico on 11 March 2024,5,"Got it with a 10% discount, it's the best processor I've ever had. It doesn't struggle with anything, though it does get quite hot. However, with a good liquid cooling system, which are already quite effective, it's manageable. I really liked it, without taking away credit from AMD, which is also doing great. But in my case, since DDR5 memories are optimized for Intel and I didn't want to deal with compatibility issues, I chose this one and I don't regret my purchase. A very good product of premium quality."
11,Ary,Reviewed in Japan on 20 May 2024,5,"Whether it's intense gaming sessions or heavy-duty productivity, this processor keeps everything running smoothly."
12,Nathan,Reviewed in Canada on 4 February 2024,5,Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
13,ARBI,Reviewed in Italy on 10 May 2024,5,"Top-notch processor, truly astonishing. Not cheap, but if you need performance, this is the right processor."
14,Francisco,Reviewed in Mexico on 30 May 2024,5,"Very good processor, but it needs good cooling."
15,Amazon lover,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,5,"So far so good.This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

17,Eric E.,Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2024,5,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAWfor the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
18,Sean,Reviewed in Germany on 22 January 2024,5,"The Intel i9-14900K is an impressive evolution from the i9-12900KF. The noticeable increase in performance I've experienced is remarkable and highlights advancements in technology. Paired with the Asus Apex Encore motherboard and fast 7200 MHz memory, it delivers superb results—I managed to achieve 41,000 points in Cinebench R23 without overclocking. This combination provides a solid foundation for demanding tasks and gaming. It's worth noting that exact performance may vary depending on the application. Overall, the i9-14900K appears to be a worthwhile investment, even if you were previously using the 12th generation."
19,Eddie Cruz,Reviewed in Mexico on 9 April 2024,5,"Among the best processors on the market. Excellent for any type of demanding task. However, it's important to pair it with good liquid cooling or it may experience thermal throttling. I had to order it twice because the first one had a common hardware error with these processors—an issue with shader compilation causing crashes in some games or programs. The second one I received arrived without any issues."
20,Christian Quintana,Reviewed in Mexico on 18 February 2024,5,"It arrived in perfect condition, the processor was exactly what I ordered: i9-14900KF. It arrived quickly and was well packaged."
21,Oneil Alberto Cuevas,Reviewed in the United States on 4 June 2024,5,"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch. The unlocked feature allows for overclocking, providing additional performance boosts as needed. Integrated graphics are a great addition, capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate GPU. This processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance, making it a top choice for anyone building a high-end PC. Whether you're gaming at the highest settings, streaming, or juggling multiple intensive applications, the i9-14900K stands up to the challenge."
22,Austin,Reviewed in the United States on 7 December 2023,5,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80? occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
23,Erick o.,Reviewed in Mexico on 15 February 2024,5,"Excellent speed, the i9-14900K really surprised me. I recommend it."
24,Deven,Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2024,5,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
25,JZ the reviewer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 February 2024,5,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip(these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoiryou should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godlycompared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("
26,Tatiana Lopez,Reviewed in the United States on 22 May 2024,5,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .
27,Esper,Reviewed in the United States on 9 June 2024,5,"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed.

31,Kitt Kavult,Reviewed in the United States on 10 May 2024,5,Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply
32,Ross,Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2024,5,"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."
33,Nick R,Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2024,5,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."

That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."

40,Les,Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024,5,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.

After upgrading from a Ryzen 3700x to this, my work speed, gaming, everything cannot lay a finger on this thing. The only time's i've seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression, decompression, and specific rendering situations. The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns. That was my original issue, but quickly upgraded coolers, and this thing is a MONSTER."

There's currently an issue that causes them to be set to insanely high values (4096W) by default causing the chip to become unstable under heavy loads.

56,Another Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2023,5,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

They all had serious stability problems when in use.After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.It does run HOT even with water cooling.IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."

With Intel's i9-14900K CPU I have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields I have an interest in. I only gave it a 4-star rating because I had hoped that Intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 Q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips.

110,Colby Pugh,Reviewed in the United States on 20 October 2023,4,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."

Temps were wild and out of control 100°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip.

125,Maul,Reviewed in the United States on 3 January 2024,3,"My 13900k never thermal throttled in any game, yet I'm getting thermal throttle spikes when playing games like Cyberpunk with the 14900k. My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone. Ridiculous that this has to be done though."
126,King-Kurt-Kauft,Reviewed in Germany on 25 February 2024,3,"I bought the CPU on Amazon and received brand-new, sealed packaging. Amazon gave it 5 stars. Regarding the Intel CPU: the generation is successful. HOWEVER, AMD's competition also has its advantages. Due to unused optimization opportunities, I have to deduct points from Intel and give it 3 stars.

Cons:

Thread Application Optimizer not available
CPUs are generally very expensive, around 300-340 euros without a cooler
Gray Area:

Gaming performance is actually very good, but compared to AMD gaming CPUs, it's satisfactory.
Power consumption: For my use cases, it's okay to good.
Pros:

High clock speeds
CPU is the most rounded overall package
Intel offers optimization opportunities through software (Thread Application Optimizer, OC RAM, Microsoft Direct Storage, modern interfaces)

It was returned because the poor silicon quality made it unsuitable for the purpose for which it was purchased. I purchased a 14900KF from Amazon to replace it and it was equally poor quality and had to go back. Intel needs to cull their trash samples and sell them at a lower price. A CPU that needs 1.500V to run stock turbo clocks is unacceptable and impossible to properly cool.

141,Mark,Reviewed in the United States on 20 March 2024,1,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built."

144,Fernando Moreno,Reviewed in Mexico on 28 May 2024,1,"The product was imported, and I understand that the box might have been opened, but it arrived with thermal paste residue, suggesting it might have been used or returned. The uncertainty of not knowing how much stress the processor endured before being sent is concerning, especially when expecting a new product.

Update: The processor indeed arrived damaged. The initial issue was preventing Windows installation. I diagnosed the problem by entering BIOS and disabling all cores, then gradually enabling them one by one. With only one core enabled, I was able to install Windows. To summarize, all E-cores functioned, but cores 4, 6, and 7 of the P-cores were damaged. Enabling any of these three cores from BIOS caused blue screens, freezes, or random program shutdowns.

While it's possible this was a factory defect, the presence of thermal paste around the edges upon arrival raised suspicions about the processor's condition. I have requested a refund."
