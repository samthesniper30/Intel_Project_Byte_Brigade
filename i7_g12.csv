1,Anish Roy,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022,5,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!"
2,Maxrock89,Reviewed in India on 29 March 2022,5,"I have paired this processor with Asus Prime Z690A motherboard and 32G 5200Mhz DDR5 ram. My usage is mostly for Adobe suite for 4K video rendering & photoediting (without dedicated eGPU) and ocassonal AAA title gaming like GTA5, Battlefield, Cpunk,etc. The processor works like a charm for rendering and Games upto 75Hz in 1080p ultra setting. Overall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits."

Lo recomiendo ampliamente, sobre todo para las personas como yo que están armando su primer PC Gamer y de trabajo y buscan pieza por pieza."
9,Inay,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 June 2024,5,"Amazing CPU previously had a i3 12100f so for me it was an extreme upgrade. Extra, more stable fps in pretty much all my games. Can also tune with intel xtu which is a good feature to have."
10,Cliente Kindle,Reviewed in Brazil on 10 July 2023,5,"É muito rápido, mas esquenta bastante, chega a usar 220W em teste de estresse. Antes de comprar, procure saber nos fóruns sobre essa questão, não importa qual cooler e pasta térmica use, ele vai esquentar muito. A única solução é fazer um ligeiro undervolt, ou diminuir o loadline calibration na BIOS. Me fez lembrar o i7-7700K que sofria do mesmo problema."
11,HoaX,Reviewed in France on 13 February 2024,5,"Comme d'hab chez Intel c'est très bon, les perfs sont juste incroyable avec le boost natif, j'ai réussi a l'OC jusqu'à 5.2Ghz et je suis sur qu'on peut monter encore avec un water custom. Seul défaut c'est que très vite quand on prend une 4080 il tire un peu la langue en 4k. Je vais devoir le changer après 2 ans à cause de bottleneck, mais sur une config avec une 3080(ti) ça doit être une très belle synergie. Très bon sur les tâches processeurs aussi, pour l'utiliser pour faire un peu de rendu les perfs sont vraiment bonnes."

13,Jacob,Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2022,5,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X. Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways... If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point. TL:DR Upgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming. Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4. Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same) Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast! Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window). I hope this review helps people!"

20,William,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2024,5,"So, being an AMD fanboy, I was not keen on getting this, but the c/t (cores to threads) kinda caught my eye. Running 12 cores, and 20 threads (4 e-cores i think) I thought, well, for the price, it should be okay? I was wrong... This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max. I would recommend this piece of kit to anyone, starting out or continuing on with building computers for their ""high end"" gaming etc. I have not once seen this struggle."
21,Camden W,Reviewed in the United States on 26 June 2024,5,This cpu is very powerful and can run games (when paired with a good graphics card) up to 300+ FPS without any problems or stutters. Make sure that you keep it cooled with a good cooler as well. It is also a great price for the product you are getting.

41,Paul Chang,Reviewed in the United States on 24 January 2024,5,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip."

I have been using the Intel brand CPU's and have been using the i7 and the K series since they were introduced. This seems to handle video processing and CAD/CAM projects quite well. I have always had great luck with Intel brand processors and will continue using them. Pretty good value for the cost.
57,bonkmaykr,Reviewed in the United States on 4 December 2023,5,"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled. The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option."

It plays every game without bottlenecking my RTX 3070 and was a breeze to install (there is literally one way to install it. <You'd have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrong). Also, it runs surprisingly cool and doesn't act like an easy-bake oven in my Motherboard."

82,Andrew W,Reviewed in the United States on 2 January 2023,5,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips. If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows: 1. i9-13900k 2. i7-13700k 3. i9-12900k 4. i5-13600k 5. i7-12700k This chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison. In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)"

85,Stephen,Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2022,5,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog. Some things to consider before purchasing: 1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4. 2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead. 3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible. Good luck!"

It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.  The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+  over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems."
87,Antonio Rodriguez,Reviewed in the United States on 20 July 2023,5,"Bought this for my new upgraded setup, I decided to pick this processor to replace my old i7 4790K, although it was still running strong after many years it was starting to show signs of aging so I completely went from 4th gen to 12th gen, performance in gaming and business apps is really noticeable."

94,D. Sroelov,Reviewed in the United States on 1 September 2022,5,"the CPU works great and is super fast.  i didn't really want to pay for the latest and greatest, mainly because i have found that a 10% increase can add 50% to the price of the CPU.  one thing to watch out for, there is no cooling fan in this package, so you have to buy one.  you can get the CPU with a fan, but it's a different part number.  personally, even though it cost more to buy the fan separately, i believe the Noctua cooler i got will work much better than anything Intel provides."
95,Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2022,5,"I've had this overclocked at 5.0 GHz for a couple weeks now and it hasn't skipped a beat. I bought an MSI Z690 MPG Edge Motherboard to pair with this beast of a chip. Keep in mind, it does NOT come with a cooler so make sure you have a reputable thermal paste and a solid cooler to pair with this. I have a pre-filled watercooler (Corsair Hydro Series H115i Pro) which is giving me temps idle as low as 19°C (not joking, look at the picture). Under full load, I have yet to hit over 50°C even gaming at 1440p (2k resolution). If I'm being quite honest, this CPU is overkill for gaming. If you have the extra money, go for it. If not, a i5-12600k will be just as powerful for less money."
96,Paul Luu,Reviewed in the United States on 22 May 2022,5,"This 12th Gen Unlocked CPU is amazing for a Gamer PC Build compared to the Ryzen 5000 Series. The new LGA 1700 boards have an added benefit compared to the aging AM4 boards. This CPU support PCIe 5.0 and DDR4 or DDR5 RAM. I like how efficient Intel designed it because the P cores are optimized for gaming while the efficient E cores deal with the background tasks. Make sure to buy a good AIO cooler because the CPU will run hot when there is lots of load! Please note a new Intel CPU will come with its Intel factory seal outside the box. Moreover, I ran the CPU under 6% when running Minecraft with raytracing."
97,JCB,Reviewed in the United States on 24 December 2022,5,I've bounced over years from AMD to INTEL and at one point settled back to INTEL.  I typically go for the i7 processors to get more life out of my systems (rather than i3 or i5 processors).  I have gotten many more years than thought out of systems and still show good usability even after 6 years.  The processor installs easily provided you have some knowledge in building computers.  No blue screening to report used with ASUS Z690M-Plus motherboard and G.SKILL memory.

There is a very slight edge to the i5-13600k in gaming performance. But, the i7-12700k runs a bit cooler and uses less load in gaming, saving you electricity. The i7-12700k is also faster in Photoshop. Overall, they are very similar in performance, but, since the i7-12700k is a bit less expensive, it offered a better value. But, you can't go wrong with either one."

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable."

Le scotch qui ferme l'emballage a l'air d'être ouvert plusieurs fois, suspectible d'être des processeurs vracs re-emballés. Sinon, le processeur n'a pas de problème pour l'instant"

180,Iddqd,Reviewed in Canada on 16 January 2024,2,Nearly all my games were crashing using this 12 Gen cpu. I later found out most games doesn’t run on alder lake due to some anti cheat bug and you need to disable e cores in the bios and am not putting up with it. I returned it and will be upgrading to 13 or 14th Gen instead.

189,Michael Crawford,Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2022,1,"I put together a gaming PC collecting parts over time as I had funds to purchase. Finally put it all together and it ran well for about 2 weeks and then I began having blue-screen crashes. Now it won't even complete a windows install on a clean drive without crashing. Tried two mother boards, 6 memory sticks, 3 NVMe drives, and two power supplies before being forced to realize the processor is causing my issue. I am now out of the quick return path grace period and must try to RMA through Amazon. If you buy one of these chips, or any part for that matter, use it right away in case it is a bad part. < Time Passes > It has been a number of months since I wrote the first part of this review and replaced this bad processor with a new identical one. That new processor has been working great and continues to run well."
190,Michael,Reviewed in Canada on 14 July 2023,1,"Does not work. Fresh out the box and along with other brand new PC parts, after putting it together the motherboard keeps flashing the CPU debug lights. I am 100% certain I put the CPU in correctly(correct facing arrows) as well as having a compatible processor socket LGA1700. I’m wondering if a replacement is covered by my warranty as I would like to having a working PC as soon as possible."
191,DCA,Reviewed in Canada on 21 October 2023,1,Bought in prime days brand new. Processor came dead on arrival. Amazon customer support refused to exchange the processor for a working one. Very bad experience. Processor was sold and shipped by amazon too
