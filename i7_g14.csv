2,Mergatroid,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,5,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch. I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost). I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM. This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it. If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."

8,Chris H,Reviewed in the United States on 31 May 2024,5,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive. Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in. So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler. I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
9,Simon R,Reviewed in Germany on 13 January 2024,5,"Nachdem ich vor einer Weile auf einen 2k 144hz Bildschirm geupgraded hab, hat mein 9600k das Bocken angefangen und konnte in letzter Zeit nicht mehr die gewÃ¼nschte Leistung bringen. Hab jetzt seit ein paar Tagen dieses gute StÃ¼ck hier und was soll man sagenâ€¦ ein Rennpferd bester GÃ¼te. High End Gaming bewÃ¤ltigt der 14700k MÃ¼helos. (ein Beispiel: Forza Motorsport unter 25% auslastung laut taskmanager und laut intel monitoring unter 5% auslastung... verwirrend) Man kÃ¶nnte  auch 2 oder 3+ Titel gleichzeitig laufen lassen wenn die Grafikkarte das mitmacht. Mit meiner aio kÃ¼hlung kann er im Stresstest schon auf 90 grad hochgehen, die ist aber schon bisschen Ã¤lter, mit einer neuen lÃ¤sst sich da sicher noch was machen. In Spielen ca. 60-70grad. die performance ist jedenfalls hervorragend das geld hat sich jedenfalls gelohnt, allerdings ist jetzt meine 3070 wieder das bottleneck ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘"

11,Big Spender,Reviewed in the United States on 13 June 2024,5,"Still love Intel despite their lack of anything groundbreaking recently. CPUâ€™s still work great for gaming, this one included. Works right out the box and went perfect with my new MSI motherboard too."
12,Mike,Reviewed in the United States on 31 May 2024,5,I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU. I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this. Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds. I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
13,KeylessCantEntry,Reviewed in the United States on 1 May 2024,5,"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core."
14,YimYorn,Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024,5,"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but Iâ€™m here to tell you itâ€™s well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I havenâ€™t gotten heat issues while gaming. Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while Iâ€™ll wait for a new 50 series card. Some of the gains Iâ€™ve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings: Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor. Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains. These are the games I normally play a lot and itâ€™s truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and havenâ€™t notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
15,E. ONeill,Reviewed in the United States on 20 May 2024,5,This 14th generation Intel Core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build. The product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow. I heartily recommend this computer processor for DIYs and computer enthusiasts.

19,Cliff Jones,Reviewed in the United States on 15 May 2024,5,this is kinda good for my GPU
20,Rich and Jen,Reviewed in the United States on 3 January 2024,5,"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.  It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking. Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.) I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out! I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job. All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."
21,Daniel CR,Reviewed in the United States on 31 December 2023,5,"Very good processor, upgraded form a very nice Ryzen 1700 (6 years old with me) to this one, decided to go intel due to memory stability. After 3 weeks I can say I love it, very nice temps while gaming and I've received around a 60% improvement in my games (I maintained my RTX3070). I'm currently using a NZXT Kraken Elite 360 AIO to cool it and it has been showing around 50-60 C during high intensive gaming which is very good. Went with this over the 7800X3D since I feel this is more future proof for productivity since I upgrade every 5-6 years. While I know the AM5 socket will last longer, anyways, every time I upgrade I also upgrade the motherboard. Very nice product, will recommend it."
22,Shawn,Reviewed in the United States on 17 November 2023,5,Was going to wait until 15th gen to upgrade my 10900k but decided to go for it. While the 10900k is still a powerhouse this is a good upgrade and I am happy with. This processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to. Cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with RT. I did pair this with a z790 Aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400. ******** AT Own Risk*******  Suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing. I am running this cpu 5.7 all cores - 1.24v on a custom loop. I see idle temps 31c - gaming 60c and cinebench 89c.  It will run hot if you're on air and do not adjust the default voltage. There are plenty of youtube videos out there as a resource.  Overall great processor

27,Pedro Navarrete,Reviewed in the United States on 19 February 2024,5,"I never had a CPU on my hands before so i was really stressed out about it ðŸ˜…, but i was able to mount it and it was the easiest part of my PC built, i don't have any idea about its perfomance yet and for now i just can say that in bios mode it keeps under 95Â°F with the AIO cooler, i will update eventualy when i finish the OS instalation"
28,Cliente de Amazon,Reviewed in Mexico on 22 March 2024,5,"El procesador llego bien empacado y con sus condiciones y funcionalidad excelente, cumple con todo; no tiene disipador de stock, pero hay tener en cuenta que para este tipo de procesadores es necesario un disipador de calor mÃ¡s eficiente que los que vienen en otros procesadores"
29,nick,Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2024,5,"They say the intel 14th gen chips run hot. If thats true then the AMD Ryzen 7 3700x's run as hot as the sun because this chip is cooler than the AMD chips. It does draw a lot of power, but it has like 20 cores. Totally worth it."
30,Dylan,Reviewed in the United States on 14 November 2023,5,Built a new system with the 14700k for photo/video editing and some gaming. Decided to go with the 14th gen i7 instead of the 13th gen since it's the only series that had a noticeable improvement (4 more e cores and threads). Very fast for video editing and overkill for most gaming. Absolutely love it! I keep it cool with a 360mm AIO and a contact plate for even lower temperatures. Avg Temps: 100% Load - Low 70's Gaming - Mid to High 40's (Low 50's for more demading titles) Idle & Browsing - Mid 20's
31,Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 24 January 2024,5,"I bought it to do computations on all cores. The best value for money I could find.

45,AK,Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2024,4,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however. There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
46,Alex,Reviewed in Germany on 18 April 2024,4,"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot ! Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboardâ€¦ these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
47,V91-Bleach,Reviewed in the United States on 3 May 2024,4,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart. The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc). Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."
48,VeganBiker,Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2024,4,I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
49,B. L. Wray,Reviewed in the United States on 29 December 2023,4,"I was never a fan of Intel's business models of locking off cores/features to try and upsell the features back to the consumer....... That aside, Intel has always been the leader in the CPU market and while AMD has been making strides in recent years Intel is still the go to for reliability and power. Anyway.... if you have money to burn and need to upgrade due to artificial obsolesces that is the new craze of forcing people to upgrade.... well, this processor will last a long time... or until they just decide it's not capable anymore."

Still below throttling, which is OK according to Intel . When gaming I only see maybe five frames per second faster at 2k res .this is a good chip.

My second gripe with this cpu is that it's basically just a refresh of 13th gen without the luxury of working out of the box with z790 mobos. You will need to flash the bios of your mobo."

58,Manas ranjan pani,Reviewed in India on 25 October 2023,2,What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money

60,Brian Lees,Reviewed in the United States on 3 April 2024,1,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note. On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)... If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard... There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."
61,SHL1,Reviewed in the United States on 3 May 2024,1,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review.  I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle.  I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective. I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.
62,Shades 2000,Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2024,1,"System booted  fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up.  Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.  When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner."

65,Zamoâ€™s,Reviewed in the United States on 4 May 2024,1,Intel I7 processor was delivered with the open box and with tape on it. When I bought It says that the I7 was brand new. Very disappointed for the right price I paid for it.
66,Alex,Reviewed in the United States on 30 March 2024,1,"CPU1 fails CPU Float test from Intel's diagnostic tools. This also never came with the signature Intel stickers, thus leading me to believe the item was repackaged after a return. I will be filing an RMA to deal with this as I wasn't able to figure this out inside the 30 day window"
67,Ada,Reviewed in the United States on 28 March 2024,1,Failed CPU after only a week of building the pc. Came in a slightly damaged package but thought it would still be okay. Did not have enough time to return or replace because of the time that it took to troubleshoot the issue.
