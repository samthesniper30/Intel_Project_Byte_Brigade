5,Steve Hardister,Reviewed in the United States on 18 December 2023,5,"Benchmarked paired with an EVGA Geoforce 3080 RTX Ti and score beat other rigs with same GPU but later series i7 and i9 CPUs. Idles in my rig  at between 55° and 60° with air cooling but doesn't go beyond 82° when stress tested. I've read where some people were concerned about it idling at 70° but it's rated to withstand 120°. So, a little warm, but high performing. Definitely worth the sale price of $287 (especially if you're used to spending around $350 for a new CPU.)",10,10,7

Savings of hundreds compared to higher range AMD processors needed to compete. Motherboard choices are slightly more expensive but if you already spend 300 to 500 on a processor, what's another 200 vs 250?? Benchmarks higher than or equivalent to Ryzen 7 and leagues faster than ryzen 5. Sweet spot for CPU demanding games but not enough for the overclocking thread ripping queens though.",10,10,10
10,Richard Collins,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 July 2021,5,This CPU is fast and runs cool. I’m glad I chose this over the more expensive I9 11th gen. i find it barely breaks a sweat when running the latest games and runs mid 40 degrees Celsius with the noctua d-15 air cooler. I did an auto overclock on the ASUS motherboard and increased its speed by 41% so I know there is plenty of headroom for the future.  I didn’t like the presentation as my box had the original Intel label with serial number covered by an Amazon label and not being able to see the batch and serial number was annoying. I managed to peel it off eventually and read my serial number. The seller explained that this was an Amazon label but I think Amazon should choose a different placement. Great chip overall.,10,10,10

38,5spdGD3,Reviewed in the United States on 1 April 2021,5,"the i7 11700K 11th gen sits in between the well reviewed i5 and the poorly priced i9 11900k. I think at this price (I got it at pre-launch sale of $399) it's a good product. It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn. Unless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you don’t - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs. Glad to be one of the first to review this. This came in as same day delivery! Happy overclocking everyone.",9,8,9

For anyone who might wonder though it is not good for gaming unless you have a dedicated graphics card. So the person who answered my question & said it was great for no video card gaming on 1080p, they lied! Any way I am running it with an RX 560 4GB right now on my UHD 52"" TV on low settings unless video cards come back down to reasonable prices again & it works fine for the games I play. If you do not game or need use of powerful graphics its great for surfing the web, watching videos & streams. Otherwise I advise you find or have a video card if you want to game or what ever.

Great CPU!

Now I can wait for a while to see if graphics cards go on sale. Update(10/18/21) I've been going through my games(450+) and so far I can play them all. To name a few: GRIM DAWN,DIVINITY ORIGINAL SIN, TRIALS OF MANA, and BOOK OF DEMONS. No separate graphics card at all. As far as I'm concerned, this processor is well worth the money.

I am going to check through everything today, maybe something changed in my bios for some reason.

Before the 11th gen, the 10900K was the fastest gaming CPU in the market. And for Intel to top it, is impressive in itself. CPU if you pair it with the right motherboard and rams you will then see its full potential. I own the 12900K for over 6 months and decided to go back to the 11gen. Even though Alder lake is more powerful, since it is very new, it has way too many drawback and the high latency of rams is the main reason why I decided to sell it.

Yes it runs warm but you wanted an excuse to buy that 360mm AIO. Two cores can overclock to 5.2 if desired. Probably could get all 8 pretty close to that with an open loop system.

104,JP,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2024,4,"Before buying, I did a lot of research on what would be the best and quietest CPU cooler, as it generates almost two the amount of heat. I have only been using it for two months, but the improvement over a 10th Gen i3 is significant. It is reliable so far. One star has been marked down because the chip is so overpriced. To be fair this is not the fault of Amazon, as all suppliers seem to be overpricing these days when we are on the 14th Gen.",5,10,9
105,Alex Hicks,Reviewed in Canada on 12 July 2021,4,"There's no denying this is a strong processor and if you want to buy something from Intel then this or the 6 core 11600k are the way to go. But if money is a consideration.  Or your power bill.  Or how much you need to spend on cooling.  Or what AMD offers.  Well, you can do better.  The similar AMD 8 core is a bit more expensive but has cheaper motherboards and draws far less power which means a smaller power bill, a smaller power supply and cheaper cooling solutions. So, yes this processor is strong.  I wanted to go Intel and needed a processor right away so that's why I own one.  But I feel like this is an offering to bridge the gap to the next generation.",7,10,6
106,Chris L,Reviewed in the United States on 25 April 2022,4,"...some of the draw backs are basically runs VERY hot even at idle compared to other generations (stays at 40+ C with 24 C ambient temp), but I concede I think I may need to adjust my case fan speeds to get a more aggressively positive pressure airflow in the case. HOWEVER< it barely gets much hotter under full load so perhaps I have tuned fairly well... Value is just OK. It is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart, and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time, but it is still close enough in price that if you CAN go with a 12th gen intel build, I would have just gone that route (I was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo, so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m.2). But it has been amazing so far in terms of performance under load, and I see this build carrying me for 4-5 years! I hope.",8,10,7

108,daniel howell,Reviewed in the United States on 6 May 2021,4,Great for gaming. Even tho AMD beats it in multi core workloads doesn't mean it's not a good processor. It's a stable reliable processor. And best of all it's in stock. In gaming it trades blows with my ryzen 5800x. So for I haven't run into any bugs or glitches. That's what you get with intel. Stability. If your only gaming I'd say this isn't the way to go. But my wife does do work station application and the extra cores reduce her time. I'd say this is niche processor and very few people would actually benefit from the extra cores. If your just gaming go with a 11600k. My daughter build is running an overclocked 11600k and it trades blows with this one.,9,9,8

110,Apes_Vs_Grapes,Reviewed in the United States on 3 February 2022,4,If you have a lga1200 platform this is my recommendation for a high performance gaming cpu.
