1,Anand stephen,Reviewed in India on 30 August 2022,5,"I brought this processor for my gaming/workstation build . Combining this processor with nzxt 360 mm liquid cooling AIO , things went smoothly. It can handle literally all heavy tasks like 3d rendering , simulation , gaming , yet keeps temprature at 40c . Highly recommended for best gaming rigs . Note: 4th gen ssd is a plus for the build ... Otherwise there might be bottleneck with gen3 ssds while doing 3d rendering works ."

7,YMS,Reviewed in Japan on 14 July 2023,5,"I purchase this CPU 1 year ago and it cost me 74,000 JPY back then. the price didn't drop much since that time and the performance is satisfying so far. the new generation spec is higher so if you want to buy this CPU don't. instead, you can buy i7 Gen13 as it will have the same spec plus a better cache than the 12 Gen. it might be better to buy the K version in case you have issues with your GPU to troubleshoot."
8,Fausto,Reviewed in Italy on 27 June 2023,5,"Processore veramente ottimo in tutte le su parti.  Ottimo il venditore che ha spedito il processore ben 10 giorni prima della scadenza prevista.

9,Malcolm,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2023,5,Bought for a friend's computer I was building. I got it in the Prime sale and it's fantasticly fast
10,jagdeep,Reviewed in Canada on 31 October 2023,5,This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issues Doesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty. CinebenchR23 Benchmarks Using CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640. Using Geek Bench 6 test I got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742

13,Leonardo,Reviewed in Italy on 15 January 2022,5,Finalmente Intel si è ricordata che produce processori. Prodotto indubbiamente al top sia come prezzo che come prestazioni. Il 12900 e comuqnue un processore di nicchia dedicato alle build più estreme o a chi davvero bisogno di grandi performance. Punti deboli consumi e temperature. Altra nota dolente mancanza di dissipatori compatibili o gravi problemi nel reperire i componenti per completare lassemblamento del PC. Consiglio caldamente per le fase di i 9 e gli i7 più estri un raffreddamento ad aria di fascia alta oppure a liquido.
14,Christopher. L,Reviewed in France on 16 November 2022,5,"Sans doute l’un des meilleurs processeur du moment du coter de Intel.  Le prix est assez élevée mais la puissance ce fait ressentir, le passage sur la ram ddr5 est selon moi le meilleurs arguments de vente et un vrai avancement pour mon setup. Très pratique pour réaliser des lives twitch sans devoir perdre de FPS en jeu."
15,Sean Dearing,Reviewed in Canada on 4 March 2024,5,This CPU has been put into my Unraid server so I could take advantage of the onboard video for Plex.  My previous AMD system I need a discrete graphics card to do the same thing.  This new CPU worked perfectly for my use case.

17,Amazonのとりこ,Reviewed in Japan on 4 June 2022,5,2022年5月に購入。 ASUSの簡易水冷(ROG240mm)で運用。ケースが古いので360mmは断念。 定格使用でH.265のエンコード時にCPU温度は80℃後半を維持できます。 Z690マザーなのでオーバークロック。 6コアまでなら倍率54で回ります。温度は90℃に届くかどうか程度。電圧はoffsetで-0.05V。この場合Core temp読みで消費電力は241Wに届きませんでした。 ただ、オールコアをいじり倍率50にしただけで300W近くまで消費するとともにCPU温度は一瞬で100℃へ。即サーマルスロットリングが作動します。 いずれも室温は27℃での検証です。 360mmの簡易水冷にしたとて一瞬で100℃に上がる温度は抑えきれないと思いますのでサーマルスロットリングに当てたくないのであればオーバークロックは難しいのでは？と思いました。 単コアであれば54倍で安定動作しているので満足です。 6700Kからの換装でしたが10分間の動画をH.265にエンコードしたとき、6700Kは約15分、12900Kは約7分で終了。 時代の変化を感じます。 premiere Proでの動画編集(4Kを8ストリーム)でも全コアフルパワーにはなりませんでした。エンコードするときと、ベンチを回すときくらいですかね。 確かに発熱しますが普段使いであれば240mm簡易水冷でも運用可能です。
18,Chris H,Reviewed in the United States on 11 May 2023,5,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."

22,DMUL,Reviewed in Canada on 1 December 2023,5,"It's not the latest gen but an overclocked I9 12th gen is more than enough for almost any gaming.  Overclocked it does demand some serious cooling, but anyone who overclocks would expect that."
23,Amazon カスタマー,Reviewed in Japan on 27 March 2022,5,ベンチマークなどで異様な負荷を与えなければそこまで熱いCPUではないです ３６０ミリが理想ではありますが通常の使用ならば280ミリでも行ける気がします さすがにベンチを永遠回すと３６０ミリラジ使用フラクタルデザインの静穏ケース天板穴なしで90度以上まであがりますがCPUなんて１００度超えなきゃ問題ないという認識なので気にしてないです アイドリングの消費電力はやっぱりINTELだなーって感じで普通に低いです まぁ巷でワッシャーレイクやらなんやら言われるCPUではありますが処理も早いし通常の使用ならそこまで熱くもないのであたふたするようなものではないのかなって感じます
24,k,Reviewed in Japan on 6 April 2022,5,ゲーミングPC用に購入、 Pコアを5.2GHzにオーバークロックして常用していす。 熱との付き合いがうまく出来ればかなり良いCPUです。 とは言え夏はまだ過ごしていないのでこれからが少し不安ですが現状は満足しています。
25,Britt Davis,Reviewed in the United States on 6 June 2024,5,Make sure you have a good Aio  NOT an msi core liquid v2 360 because that one died on me and this was seeing 80-90c idle other than that this processor is pretty good when its cooled properly.
26,Mike,Reviewed in Canada on 14 October 2022,5,"This thing never goes over 15 percent usage, and most games its actually using 0-4 percent. Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking. My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs. I'm really shocked on how good its performance is, Definitely recommend."
27,BlueIce,Reviewed in the United States on 22 June 2024,5,I used this to upgrade a system I built two years ago.  I was going t use a 14th gen i9.  but for all the issues I have heard and read about with the 13th and 14th gen i9's having I went safe route.  I hate to have a computer crash cause of manufacture intel 13th and 14th gen i9 defects!!!!
28,Spenny,Reviewed in Canada on 3 March 2024,5,Just a quick swap from a I5 to this on a 660 mobo Noticed a difference right away in cities skylines 2 That's all I needed
29,Steve Dervs,Reviewed in Canada on 6 January 2024,5,"Faster Read, Write speeds than I-7. Easy Install. I recommend a Liquid cooler if you Overclock--otherwise the revved Fan noise will irritate you. I returned one -new unopened because the Motherboard I ordered for it arrived Damaged."
30,Kira,Reviewed in the United States on 21 February 2022,5,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."

33,bilal waheed,Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2023,5,"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny."
34,2sofakinggreat,Reviewed in the United States on 2 January 2023,5,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings. After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions. For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed. So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well. Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer. If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."

36,Vernon Hendon,Reviewed in the United States on 26 November 2023,5,"It took me less than 15 minutes to take out my current 1700 series CPU (i7 12700K) and add in this new one.  Removed the AIO cooler, cleaned off the thermal paste, applied new past after inserting and wala' it's up and running like a champ.  I'm not a gamer, so yes I understand it's not a huge bump in performance for those applications. Video Editing is another story."

38,Martazcoleman,Reviewed in the United States on 11 September 2023,5,"Are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first PC build I chose this chip and I didn’t know it runs that hot I built my PC I had enough fans but I had a 240 mm radiator I want a Micro Center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool. The temps were at 89 to 92°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%. It’s pretty overkill but that’s how I like my PC."
39,MSA,Reviewed in the United States on 7 August 2023,5,"Purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase (this was actually cheaper than the i7). Paired with RTX 4060TI 8GB. NO regrets. This can handle anything I throw at it, without issue (gaming wise) and never goes above 50/55C (not overclocked and cooled with 240MM AIO from Corsair) Idles around 32/33C Very responsive with plenty of clearance if I ever want to OC this guy. Heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240MM radiator (sitting over a 4060Ti), but no issues - heat or performance) at all. Great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently."

46,Metragoon,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2022,5,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming. I highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen Alder Lake family.

Don’t know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the CPU during the build. After all CPU is the most or second mot expensive component in a PC build. Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, couple with gen 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow"

Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard  and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios. Blows away anything currently AMD is offering in the same price range.

The manufacturer's install nstructions didn't mention that the base bracket goes underneath the MB. I thought it was just there to protect the cooler during shipment. Nothing to do with the seller.

103,Smart Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2023",5," recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.

Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.

The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.

The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers."
104,Poolboy16,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2022",5,"My primary use case for the 12900k is gaming and encoding video. Personally I could justify the higher price tag over the competing i5 and i7 because of my specific use case. Good Things: The processor is absolutely and insanely powerful. I am encoding 1080, 30fps video roughly 50% to 80% faster give or take than my previous processor which was a 11700kf! One single generation and an i9 upgrade has saved me astronomical amounts of time. As far as gaming goes… I would say is more heavily reliant on a graphics card so I won’t go into much detail on that. Overall this processor is wonderful and deserves its 5 stars. Not so good things: I didn’t take a star off for this because it isn’t really a problem rather just the way the processor is designed. It uses a metric ton of power, I’m talking 241 watts during my normal video encoding sessions. Which in turn generates a space heater worth of heat. One of those things “great power comes great responsibility”. I am telling you this because you NEED TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COOLER. I am currently using a Noctua NH-D15 and it’s okay. I would recommend it to anyone that prefers air cooling but nothing less. If you choose a cooler that is less you will regret it. I would venture to say you need the cooler I have mentioned or 280mm and above AIO to even keep it from thermal throttling at heavy load. Do not underestimates this, gaming it is much more tame, still running high temperatures but better. I still would get a really great CPU Cooler or otherwise you WILL be thermal throttling like crazy. Overall this is a great CPU and although not worth it for some, can be a great processor if it is worth it. Just beware of the watts and heat. I was dumbfounded."
105,Chris H,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023",5,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."

109,Kira,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2022",5,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."

111,bilal waheed,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023",5,"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny."
112,2sofakinggreat,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023",5,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings. After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions. For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed. So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well. Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer. If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."

115,jenksdrummer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 May 2022,5,"I came from an AMD 2990WX build that while it was good and stable, always had some quirks about it that just annoyed the crap out of me at best. While this probably can't multithread to the same degree, it does represent a lot of power and speed. 5.2GHz across 8 cores / 16 threads, on an air cooler and I'm not touching anything for OC...it's great as it is. Even the 'slow' cores clock in upwards of 4GHz, which the TR tapped out at best with 4.2 and that was only for a couple cores-worth. This one on air, does back off that max clock not soon afterwards; but I also have this in a 4u rack mounted case, with 4 chassis fans; vs the previous build which was on a 360 radiator/AIO, and had 13 system fans; but I was going for a rather ridiculous build with that vs this build I'm going for subtle/sleeper. That this system runs as fast as it does, with as little fan noise, on air...is something rather amazing."

117,RFM,Reviewed in the United States on 10 December 2022,5,"The various letters at the end of the Intel processor can indicate several things ""K' processors are unlocked and can be overclocked. And there are 12-14 versions indicating their use or level of processing. This is a ""KS"" which is unlocked and what they call a ""special edition"". Each processor Intel produces is tested before shipment and when its abilities are tested as above average it is given the ""S"" designation. This means it has that little extra ability to process. The processors that test lower may be used for other applications and/or the graphics ability is turned off. Anyway, the ""KS' can be thought of as the best processor, especially for gaming and it normally will cost a little more than the other varieties"

138,Aaron,Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2022,4,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy. For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future. The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too."
139,Fuzz,Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2022,4,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250."

Removed the cpu and placed into motherboard ( new lga 1700 mb with the latest bios ). booted up the system and it reported and showed a Celeron G6900. This is unacceptable. Working with amazon support on returning it now. for the replacement unit I will video opening the box and the cpu as it is removed.  Have not had this issue before with a sealed box.
151,Oren Kirchhoff,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2024,3,I ended up returning the product because it the delivery date was late 3 different times and I needed the processor at the original delivery date. The item was shipped late and then the delivery was delayed 2 different times. And the processor was in the smaller box and not the package in the picture. It was the correct processor and the price for it was fair but some people rely on that delivery date sometimes.
152,Kris Napoli,Reviewed in the United States on 6 March 2023,2,Genuinely not someone who leaves reviews but $500 and it gets packaged like this? The cpu box itself is fine but the case isn’t even in the box anymore bc it fell out to due crap packing
153,Carey Robson,Reviewed in Canada on 10 August 2022,2,Everything seemed okay until I placed the chip on my motherboard; something seemed wrong. A Pentium of some sort was substituted and my motherboard damaged. Amazon replaced and I am waiting for a refund on the board. Who would have thought?

158,Electrosoft,Reviewed in the United States on 16 December 2021,1,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU. Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal. If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry. My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes. Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting. Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside. Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision. Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen."
159,Vinyl Friend,Reviewed in the United States on 8 February 2022,1,"Upgraded from a i9-9900k. Using windows 11 I can absolutely say this system is soooo much slower. I work in Adobe programs. Their responsiveness and general speed is so painful. I'm considering going back to my old rig, or going back to window 10. have 64gb RAM + RTX 3090 + 980 NVME 512gb in RAID0. Never has having the latest felt like a significant step back."
160,Tony,Reviewed in the United States on 27 April 2022,1,As other mentioned there was something off with these chips. This was a new build. I have no video - i've swapped RAM and the motherboard I get no errors on the mother board - there are lite for errors NO GO - far too much time and money wasted of this - I am returning the processor and ordering elsewhere
161,mark manning,Reviewed in the United States on 10 February 2022,1,i purchased this item then waited about a week for it.  when it got here it was ***NOT*** the item i purchased but a lobotomized version of it with no integrated graphics.  I purchased the advertised item SPECIFICALLY because it had integrated graphics.  the item i received requires discrete graphics. ABSOLUTE BS and UTTERLY unacceptable.
162,Henry,Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2022,1,If you get this processor it has high temps problems if you look it up you see online that it cant handle top of the line liquid coolers bought intel i9-12900ks works like a champ no high temp problems the best one out there!
163,Alex,Reviewed in the United States on 21 May 2022,1,"Received the product, everything on the packaging said i9-12900k. But the processor inside the case was a celeron G6900.. Make sure you check the chip that you receive when purchasing."
164,Martin,Reviewed in the United States on 15 May 2022,1,I connected my i9 12900k but the computer detects this as Celeron G6900 with 2 cores... Is this a scam? I need a solution

166,S1lence1,Reviewed in the United States on 25 August 2022,1,You would expect when you buy the highest quality product from intel they would at least tell you how to orient it into the motherboard.

172,Ali-a-Sachez,Reviewed in the United States on 2 July 2024,1,"Shortly after use my pc started to blue screen randomly, eventually it got so bad windows wasn't even able to boot from bios without instantly crashing. Thought perhaps it was my own user error, however after changing literally every other component in my pc I finally concluded that the processor was bad, and when I bought a new i7 and tried it out everything was back to working proper. So, now I'm out 400, and I'm past the return period, complete waste of money, GET AN I7 INSTEAD, THIS THING IS GARBAGE."
173,Received a FAKE processor!,Reviewed in the United States on 12 April 2023,1,"Factory sealed, all looks good, until you open the box, and BAM! You’re hit with an intel Celeron G5900 or whatever the hell that 50$ processor is, total fraud and a total scam, would not even recommend buying this!"
