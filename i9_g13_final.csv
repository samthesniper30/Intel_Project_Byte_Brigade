1,Thomas Lepschies,Reviewed in Germany on 18 June 2023,1,"Erstmal muss ich sagen das die Lieferung echt fix ging, Termin war f√ºr die darauffolgende Woche Mittwoch angedacht, aber das P√§ckchen kam schon Freitag. Ich dachte mir nur, geil alle Teile zusammen und es kann ans zusammenbauen gehen. Also fing ich an das Mainboard auszupacken , alles sch√∂n zurecht gelegt und wollte dann die CPU auspacken, wunderte mich das die Verpackung schon auf war, ü§î dachte ich, aber egal, weiter geht's. Ich machte die Verpackung wo jetzt die CPU drin sein sollte auf und sah einen Hauch von Nichts üò≥ toll, dachte ich, 630‚Ç¨ weg. Denke mal das sich da jemand im Amazon Lager wie im Selbstbedienungsladen gef√ºhlt hat. Gleich Amazon angerufen und keine 10 min sp√§ter kam die Mail das der Betrag erstattet wird. Alles sehr komisch und √§rgerlich,  aber am Ende doch f√ºr micht noch gut ausgegangen . Hab jetzt nochmal bei einem anderen Anbieter bestellt und hoffe das es da nicht wieder eine b√∂se √úberraschung gibt."
2,Mohammad Attaran,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 May 2023,1,After 3 months it appeared that my processor is faulty. I discussed the issue with Intel support and they happily agreed to replace it with a new one. But I still had to discuss this with the reseller. They have a very bad support and hardly answer my messages time to time with short sentences.

4,Zev,Reviewed in the United States on 2 July 2023,1,"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11.  I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues.  I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue. I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine. I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code. I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me. And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue. An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still. It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now. Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky."

7,Erik Gerlitz,Reviewed in the United States on 21 April 2024,1,"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google. For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes. After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public. Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases. Unacceptable for a company worth over $100B to push out a product like this."
8,KetchupSoup,Reviewed in the United States on 30 May 2024,1,"I saved up for years to upgrade my PC, which I built from scratch to use for streaming. After a couple of months of using this new chip, I started getting constant game/system crashing whenever playing Destiny 2, or Fortnite. Basically has put my livestreaming/content creation job on hold, because of the constant crashing. Here are my specs... MOBO: ASUS Prime Z790-A WiFi 6E CPU: Intel Core i9-13900K GPU: XFX Speedster MERC310 AMD Radeon RX 7900XT RAM: 128GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM"
9,T. S.,Reviewed in the United States on 30 October 2023,1,"This I9 chip is very likely guilty of destroying 2 ASUS ROG Maximus Hero Z790 motherboards.  The first motherboard was ordered from Amazon with this chip.  The second was a replacement sent by ASUS for a relatively small fee compared to the cost of the first.  Picture number 1 is the offending chip.  Picture number 2 is the socket of the first motherboard after it destroyed it (picture taken by ASUS service).  Picture number 3 is the socket of the replacement motherboard ASUS sold me cheap AFTER this I9 destroyed it (wife's picture).  Since it arrive 15 Sept, Amazon says they can't help me.  Intel is thinkimng about what they are going to do.  Bottom line:  I'm out $900 for motherboards and Amazon and ASUS have declined to help any more.  We'll see what Intel does.  I've spent ~15 hours dealing with this: setting up and taking apart a computer that still doesn't work (no motherboard and a MB killer CPU), and support calls.  Moral of my story: Unless you feel lucky, DO NOT buy a motherboard and CPU and count on them working together.  Rather, just pay some integrator to sell you a motherboard, CPU, and memory that have been tested to work together."
10,Unive,Reviewed in the United States on 2 December 2023,1,"Ive switched out PSUs, MOBOs, SSD's. Ive even sent my 4080 on an RMA process with gigabyte trying to understand where all my problems are coming from and at the end of the day it's this CPU. Ive experienced nothing but an awful time with this thing. I regret buying it, I regret spending all the money on my new build when I should have just went with AMD. In a year or so I am going to try to sell off the 4080 and other parts and just chunk this piece of garbage into a landfill. ___ The computer is only stable in power saved mode in the power options. With most games that are intensive, as soon as the CPU is needed, stuff just starts crashing. You literally have to throttle this CPU down to have system stability. The windows battery saver mode if you look at the hidden registry files, it alters the CPU by throttling it down. Resulting in poor performance from what should be a high-end build and it's just sad."
11,Steve,Reviewed in the United States on 13 March 2024,1,"I purchased this CPU bundled with the ASUS TUF Gaming Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard. That started me chasing my tail for 3 weeks. I ended up soliciting the help of Geek Squad as they had the spares needed to make a proper evaluation. After 5 motherboards (2 manufacturers) and 4 i9-13900K CPU's. We finally found a winner. According to Geek Squads' advanced support, Intel has had a recent production problem with this CPU. They say it's not uncommon to go through 4 or 5 CPU's before finding a good one. Well I saw it with my own eyes. Intel has always had such a good reputation I was reluctant to reach that conclusion. But apparently this is the case. I understand that previous generations are not affected."
12,Alec R.,Reviewed in the United States on 11 May 2024,1,I have this CPU still because I spent a bunch of money on it. It over heats and overclocks itself. Not stable even after I undervolted and overclocked it. I messed with my bios too to try and help it also got a AIO cooler and new case for it. Nothing works terrible purchase and it has been too long for my protection plan it ran out its a big shame.
13,Mr. T,Reviewed in the United States on 15 April 2024,1,"I could not get a signal to o my monitor from my new computer build. Finally took entire computer to professional computer repair shop and it was determined that the brand new Intel CPU chip was D.O.A. Because it took me 31 days to learn how to assemble a computer by watching YouTube videos and then get it diagnosed by a computer shop, I had to eat the cost of this worthless chip. There is no excuse to have such bad quality control on such an expensive item."
14,Brian Hagen,Reviewed in the United States on 29 February 2024,1,"Worked fine for 4 months then it started crashing and freezing.  It destroyed the OS kernel and the OS had to be reinstalled.  I finally had to take it to a local computer repair place and $400 later in attempts to diagnose all of the components and fix it, it turns out that this cpu won't work properly with c-states enabled.  C-States tells it to stop sending power to cores when they aren't in use.  This means my computer won't be able to go to sleep or hibernate.  It's either on or off.  They suggested I get the cpu replaced but of course, its past the exchange time."

16,Mark R,Reviewed in the United States on 27 August 2023,1,Processor was fulfilled by Amazon and was dead on arrival. Tried it on another known good motherboard and it still didn‚Äôt work. Returned the processor per the instructions and the refund was supposed to be issued by the 27th of August (almost 3 weeks) the 27th has arrived and Amazon has changed the refund date and tacked on another 3 days and now says a refund will be issued by the 30th. Enough is enough! I want my money back for an item that didn‚Äôt work! Do I have to reverse the charges with my bank?
17,Bitronic,Reviewed in Canada on 9 December 2023,1,The Intel 13th gen CPUs have been a big disappointment. I originally had a faulty 13900KS which intel replaced with a 13900K and they refunded the difference of the 13900KS because they had none in stock. That was a loss of my original savings and no compensation by Intel. Next system will be an AMD for sure.
18,keli,Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2024,1,I am currently in the process of replacing this cpu since mine is defective. Read the threads and do research into how people have constant issues with these crashing. Upgrade to the 14th gen and skip the chance of a defect.

21,Efren P.,Reviewed in the United States on 24 March 2023,1,"What I dislike? You would think that you will not get a bad CPU from a reputable company, makes it more difficult to troubleshoot when building a computer with limited resources. This is the last component that you will think that it will go bad when troubleshooting. With this experience I have to give it a one star although it worked flawlessly after it was replaced."

30,Mas,Reviewed in the United States on 5 January 2024,1,"This is my experience, I doubt that this is actually a problem with the processor itself, and more compatibility issue of the motherboard that I put it on, but I expected because it ran on 400 and 500 series motherboards that that meant that since mine is a 400 that it would run on it, I was wrong, the PC would not post when I put this processor on, I tried exchanging for another, and it did the same thing PC would not boot at all, it would go into a turn on then off then on then off then on then off then on then off cycle where nothing would actually show up on the monitor just my case fans would light up and then turn off and then light up and then turn off. So I don't know if the problem is with the processor or if I have a board compatibility issue, but I think I should not have had a board compatibility issue, and I have a 900 W power supply so there's no reason why there wasn't enough power to boot, I also used a liquid cooler so it should have had zero heat problems. I put a 12,900K on my motherboard from a 12700 KF which is what came with the computer, and the 12900K boots just fine. I am running a Lenovo legion t5 Gen 7. Should be compatible I don't see why it wouldn't be, but I have yet to try any other 13th generation processors to find out."
31,John Wolf,Reviewed in Canada on 14 March 2024,1,This CPU quit after four months. I cannot get in touch with Amazon customer support nor can I connect with anyone at Intel.

Throttles within 30 seconds of running cinebench. I'm so upset that I decided to go intel instead of amd. Literally sunk well over $2000 on aio's and fans and eventually a new case and custom loop just to get NORMAL TEMPERATURES and not throttle nonstop.. and there's been no improvement at all. I've reseated it probably a hundred times by now trying every thermal paste there is, with every method of application. It's not fair that I've had to invest thousands into Intel to be left with a useless machine. Do not buy this chip or anything from Intel."

It couldn't be Intel's fault, I mean, I've had dozens of intel CPUs over the years, and never had a problem. But this thing.... How do I know IT is the problem? When I set CPU affinity in Task Manager and limit the number of cores software has access to, everything runs fine. Slicing, games, my frigging web browser even! But if I unlock those applications and go 'all cores', stuf crashes left and right, the CPU bluescreens regularly, simple things like comfyUI crash the browser just by clicking on a node. HellDivers 2 can only be played between 2 and 10 minutes without crashing. All bets are off if I have 4 players. Just avoid this model. Get a different one or wait for the next iterationl."

Although baseline is about 33C on HWINFO, when using Cinebench -- it eventually starts thermal throttling after starting at 85C Peaks at over 360W, for just the CPU -- so this CPU needs a professional cooler, as the two fan cooler was working but just couldn't keep up with how insanely hot this thing runs. I tried using everything, from different thermal pastes and liquid metal -- all of which failed. Most people probably buy this CPU and have no idea that it's beeing throttled during benchmarking. I was sadened by all the posts on redit mentioning to undervolt or turn off multicore optimization, lol... Great CPU if you don't care about electricity and have a great cooler."

SP 111/88 = 103 Cooling: 170 When the throttle happens, both P-cores and E-cores drop, causing performance hits in normal tasks as well as games. ASUS motherboard at default settings attempts to send extreme amounts of voltage to the CPU (1.4+) in order to reach boost rating (no XMP). This has literally been the most difficult processor to reign in heat I've had to deal with in my 30 years of computing, AMD is starting to look good I guess (which is why I switched to and have remained with intel for 20 years, AMD ran hot back in the day). Apparently even the 14900k's are having issues.

Really you should be looking at AMD X3D chips if you want the god chips, and if you want to stick with intel for reliability, the i5 does not bottleneck the 4090.

But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance. But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors."

61,Carlos Canales,Reviewed in the United States on 26 May 2024,3,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease. Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results. Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications. In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD. Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU."
62,IndyToronto,Reviewed in Canada on 31 May 2024,3,"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before. The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C. One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V. Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down. So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.  These systems had no GPU, only motherboard, 64GB of DDR5, and an SSD.  Has anyone else seen this?"

While my AIO does allow it to run at 5700MHz at 100C, the CPU is using over 330 Watts at that speed & delivering an impressive Cinebench score of 41697.  Basically it's too much CPU for any cooler on the market.  Even manually clocking the CPU at 4500MHz cap sees temps at 92C with fans on 100% speed. To get a decent daily use speed that doesn't drive the fans at freight train noise levels, I have to manually down-clock the CPU to 3500MHz which still gives great gaming performance, but keeps the fans down to about 60% fan speed. While the CPU is great for video editing, I don't think that it's worth the premium price over the 3GHz 13900K processor.  Wish I had saved some $$$ instead of going for the higher clock rate....."

76,Roenin,Reviewed in Italy on 2 November 2023,4,"Il miglior processore nel 2022-2023 per chi vuole sia videogiocare che lavorare. Purtroppo anche con l'undervolting come efficienza √® un disastro, in gaming arriva a consumare 3-4 volte di pi√π rispetto a quanto dovrebbe. Quando guardo un film mi spara ogni tanto la frequenza al massimo consumando 25-30 watt in Idle o quasi, mah. Mi sono dovuto sbattere per fare dei profili energetici personalizzati con QuickCPU per avere un consumo accettabile, per√≤ sono comunque scomodi da cambiare per ogni gioco e applicazione, anche con PowerPlanSwitcher. La colpa √® anche di windows che non aiuta, perch√® non fa scalare la frequenza in base al consumo. Poi ho anche notato che windows preferisce usare l'HT dei P-cores piuttosto che gli e-cores aumentando l'inefficienza e causando cos√¨ anche cali di prestazioni dato che i cores logici sono molto meno potenti dei cores efficienti. Come overclock non c'√® nulla da fare, il massimo per restare nel PL2 e nel TMax 90¬∞ in full √® 5.8Ghz su 2-3 cores, 5.7GHz su 7 cores e 5.5GHz su tutti i P-cores, comunque settandolo cos√¨ diventa pi√π inefficiente coi processi che richiedono meno cores. Ho notato che la CPU ha uno sweet spot a 5.3GHz in cui le prestazioni, l'efficienza e le temperature sono molto meglio, quindi uno dei power plan che ho fatto con QuickCPU limita il clock a tale frequenza. La cosa pi√π positiva √® che rispetto ad AMD √® possibile overclockare la memoria ed aumentare le prestazioni del 10-15% nelle le app e nei giochi che ne usano tanta e facendo cos√¨ la CPU diventa pi√π efficiente dato che le memorie consumano pochi watt e velocizzano le prestazioni computazionali e viene colmata un p√≤ la differenza con la 3D VCache di AMD proprio nelle applicazioni in cui ha la meglio. Io per avere questo risultato le ho overclockate a 6667 CL32 con il VDD safe a 1.435v ed ho abbassato i timing secondari e terziari, fate attenzione che se non fate un overclock per come si deve potreste non avere alcun beneficio, √® roba molto per smanettoni, tra 4800 CL40 stock e 7200 CL34 stock cambier√† solo del 5%. Come gioco di prova a fine overclock ho usato Rust che √® tra i giochi che beneficiano di pi√π delle RAM e delle cache veloci e la differenza √® impressionante, sono passato da 115 FPS col profilo XMP 5200 stock a 135 FPS con 6667 CL32. Probabilmente con una scheda madre di fascia alta e le RAM coi die che raggiungono i 8600MHz potete fare di meglio, ma l'importante √® il miglior compromesso tra frequenza e timings. Non prendete la versione F perch√® √® inutile, non ha senso di esistere, la GPU integrata vale 50‚Ç¨, la pagate quasi nulla e quando serve √® sempre l√¨ pronta, io ci ho collegato il secondo monitor e il Quick Sync di Intel per registrare e elaborare video √® buono, consuma veramente poco 1-10watt, non influisce sulle temperature, potete disattivarla quando volete ed √® estremamente utile anche in caso di guasto della dedicata."

Inoltre.. vi servir√† un dissipatore con i controfiocchi per dissipare 250-300 Watt di energia ... e non basta un normale AIO a liquido da 360 con 3 ventole da 120... deve essere un dissipatore dalle caratteristiche extra per riuscire a tenere sotto i 100¬∞ la cpu sotto stress e quindi non farla andare in thermal throttling. Probabilmente un i5 o un i7 di 13ma generazione sono pi√π adatti alla maggior parte degli utenti, e consumano meno. oltre a costare meno. Inoltre... se prevedere di usare una scheda video potreste preferire la versione i9 13900f , che non include una gpu integrata nel processore. perch√®? perch√® molte schede madri disabilitano automaticamente la igpu integrata se nel computer avete una scheda video vera. quindi sarebbero soldi spesi inutilmente.

92,elviscera,Reviewed in the United States on 21 June 2023,4,"Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF, I have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage.  Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare. I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering. FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator. All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.  It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU."

116,j,Reviewed in the United States on 3 May 2024,5,"I love it, works great. I paired this with 128GB using G.SKILL Ripjaws S5 Series (Intel XMP 3.0) DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 5600MT/s CL28-34-34-89 1.35V Desktop Computer Memory UDIMM - Matte Black (F5-5600J2834F32GX2-RS5K), this is the fasted 5600 MT/s DDR5 I could find on Amazon at the time of purchase and I specifically chose the 5600 MT/s because as it is advertised on Intel's website for the i9-13900k. It works really good, very very fast, and can ***multi task heavy software like they're nothing*** and with a push pull AIO it averages around 28*C and when I'm gaming it stays around 50-40*C with graphics maxed out. Much love and gratitude to Intel! This works great with gaming and also data science, which work is the main reason I bought this. I also used the Thermal Grizzly - KryoSheet (38x38x0,2mm) for this as well so I don't have to worry about paste drying up on my i9 <3 and lemmy tell you it fits PERFECTLY and pairs well with a CPU contact frame too, and after almost half a year I've yet to have any problems, only good results."

What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.  Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well.  I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it.  The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees.  This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great.  I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock.  I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup."

139,Adam White,Reviewed in the United States on 22 February 2023,5,"I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine. Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5. I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint. A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great."
140,Real Reviews,Reviewed in the United States on 14 November 2023,5,"I really like this CPU and it has worked well for my needs. Many had the issue of overheating, throttling and even bending in some instances. I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly. I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious. This has also been installed on the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX motherboard. As long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing CPU."

Even without overclocking this puppy will handle anything I've thrown at it with ease.  But like all the reviews you see online say, it puts out some serious heat.  I've had it for about 4-5months now, before it started cooling off outside I was have to crank the A/C to keep my gaming room cool and now that its cooling off outside (30-40 f at night) I have blocked off the vents in the room to prevent any additional heat.

I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesn‚Äôt generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don‚Äôt be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent.

152,Pierre Aubert Espenan,Reviewed in the United States on 24 February 2023,5,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C."
153,Joaquin,Reviewed in the United States on 29 May 2023,5,"Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one. Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100¬∞C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67¬∞C) but is something to be aware of. All in all happy with this beast"

Contact frame went in the trash, so another motherboard would not.  Using the stock CPU holder/ loading mechanism."

156,Chris,Reviewed in the United States on 28 June 2023,5,"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users. If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking)."
157,T,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2024,5,It works as intended. Needed the upgrade.
158,Mike Alering,Reviewed in the United States on 28 September 2023,5,"If youre going with an AIO get a 360mm cooler. I tried using a 240mm and it just wasnt enough to cool the CPU during some Starfield. That out of the way, this thing is seriously impressive. Even with how un optimized some of these new games are, I have never seen anything use it beyond 80% other than some CPU specific tasks."
159,Happy Server Buyer,Reviewed in the United States on 28 November 2022,5,"i9-13900K or KF. Fast install onto a Supermicro Board x13SAE-f with server memory with IPMI for remote access or an Asus Board such as Z690-f with DDR5 where you can buy an IPMI attachment, and it throttles rather than crashes when it overheats. Or just for gaming and office use this CPU beats everything else to date.  Buy one now and if you have an i9-12900K or KF sell it. Pay attention to the necessary new BIOS install. Not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as CPU temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger Air Fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you. Same thing happens on my more than twice the price Thread Ripper 3970x and not a big deal. This a server class CPU."

Has plenty of fast L 3 cache on die so there's no delay or speed issues. It also runs my Team Group DDR 5 7800Mhz ram with no problem on my Maximus Z790 Hero chipset Motherboard. Wanted to get the EVGA Z790 Kingpin motherboard but it sells out very fast within minutes. Great CPU and I'm very happy that I've bought the Intel 13900K.

209,Scott Atkinson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2023,5,"I installed this CPU a month or so ago now, alongside 64gb RAM, on an ASUS TUF Gaming Motherboard. The TLDR; It's lightening quick, and It's super easy to install. As with all CPU's care should be taken when installing and handling the CPU, but other than that it's relatively straight forward. All I have to say, is this CPU is a beast. Like its so overkill for the average user. In for gaming it is just overkill. It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes. My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature. My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years."

213,Simon Leat,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 August 2023,5,"CPU working just as it should be. People's main concern with this product is obviously the temps. To reassure people, and from a VFX artist's perspective, my temperatures are respectable. I have the Corsair H170I ELITE CAPELLIX 420 mm AIO attached to it. When running tasks like having Opera open with even 30 tabs, Spotify, file browser and settings all open at the same time, my temps max at 34 degrees Celsius. When I'm in Unreal engine it never goes above 45 (but yes it is mainly GPU real-time rendering). it will use around 10 % of the CPU still however. in Cinema 4d viewport it will never go above 34c, when rendering a 4k 3d scene it ranges from 70-86 degrees Celsius max. whatever software I'm using whether it's Adobe software, c4d, unreal, Houdini, Davinci, it will never hit over 90c. Installation was absolutely fine and considering this was the first ever system I've built, so it demonstrates how easy it was to put into the motherboard if you just follow instructions to a tee. The H170I also comes with pre-applied thermal paste so I didn't even have to worry about that which was a bonus. and it's obviously doing its job at transferring all that heat.

218,Marc Hoffmann,Reviewed in Germany on 2 April 2023,5,"Ich wusste ja worauf ich mich einlasse. Der 13900K ist ein absolutes Monster. Nicht nur in Sachen Leistung, sondern auch in Sachen Stromhunger und Abw√§rme. Ich halte mich mal kurz: F√ºr Video Arbeit und Rendering absolut top! Tonnenweise Rechenleistung f√ºr Software Encoding und Rendering. Der Intel Quicksync Encoder kann h.265 Videos in 4K mehr als 3 mal(!) so schnell rendern wie meine 1080ti die ich bisher daf√ºr verwendet habe (Mit einem 7700K der etwa 80-90% der leistung der 1080ti lieferte). F√ºr Gaming muss man nichts weiter sagen. In aktuellen Games ist meine 1080ti permanent am Limit und die CPU langweilt sich, wo sonst der 7700K alles ausgebremst hat. Ansonsten gibts genug reviews die zeigen wie viel Power in dem kleinen st√ºck gepresster technik steckt. Nun zu den wichtigen punkten die ich nicht wirklich kritisiere sondern nur darauf Aufmerksam machen will: Ja der Strombedarf und die Abw√§rme sind auf einer ganz neuen Liga. Die meisten Gaming Motherboards ballern die CPU mit Spannung zu damit alles stabil ist. Damit ist dieser Prozessor aber nicht zu k√ºhlen, egal wie gut der CPU K√ºhler ist. Er wird IMMER in die 100¬∞C rennen aufgrund des limits des Heatspreaders. Ich nutze einen Arctic Freezer II 280mm Drei dinge habe ich gemacht um die temperaturen unter kontrolle zu bringen: 1. den Thermalright Contact Frame gekauft. Habe erst den original Intel Mount verwendet und renne damit sofort ins Thermal Limit. Mit dem Contact Frame habe ich sofort die Temperaturen um 4-8¬∞C Pro Kern gesenkt und damit vom permanenten thermischen Drosseln auf gelegentliche hickser in die temp drossel gebracht mit Cinebench R23. 2. Undervolting. Auf dem Asus Prime Z790-A habe ich die kernspannung per offset bei laufendem Cinebench langsam immer weiter abgesenkt. XMPII ist aktiviert. erst in 0.02V schritten bis zum Bluescreen und dann ran getastet. Stabil in Cinebench war ich dann bei -0.135V, hatte dann sp√§ter beim Zocken noch einen BSOD und nun auf -0.13V absolut stabil. CPU Package Power im Cinebench damit von 310W peak power und 295W average auf 270W peak power und 260W average im Cinebench gesenkt. das hat ganze 10¬∞C auf der CPU gebracht im Cinebench 10min test. 3. Liquid Metal. Eigentlich nicht notwendig aber ich wollte noch ein paar grad los werden um genug reserven f√ºr den Sommer zu haben. Hat nochmal weitere 4-6¬∞C temperatur gesenkt. Nach diesen Anpassungen bin ich jetzt mit ALL Cores im dauerhaften Turboboost bei 5.5GHz+4.3GHz, ohne drosselung bei 80¬∞C peak single run Cinebench R23 und unter 90¬∞C im Dauertest mit einer auf leise getunten L√ºfterkurve. ACHTUNG: Mit diesen settings ist die CPU nicht stabil in Prime95 und wird das system crashen! Hier muss die Loadline Calibration auf Stufe 5 gesetzt werden was aber dann alte Power Level wieder zur√ºck bringt. Undervolting ist nicht f√ºr jede Anwendung geeignet. Da muss man dann auch mit den 100¬∞C Limits leben, wenn man nicht Direct-Die K√ºhlen will."

220,Damir,Reviewed in Germany on 4 May 2024,5,"Ich habe den Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-13900K Desktop-Prozessor in meinem neuen Gaming PC verbaut und bin absolut begeistert von seiner Leistung! Dieser Prozessor mit seinen 24 Kernen (bestehend aus 8 P-cores und 16 E-cores) und 36 MB Cache hat meine Erwartungen √ºbertroffen. Der i9-13900K sorgt f√ºr eine unglaubliche Gaming-Erfahrung. In Kombination mit der ASUS ROG RYUJIN III 360 ARGB AIO-Wasserk√ºhlung bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions k√ºhl und leise. Die K√ºhlleistung ist einfach hervorragend und erm√∂glicht eine konstant hohe Leistung des Prozessors. In meinem neuen Gaming-Setup l√§uft der i9-13900K zusammen mit der NVIDIA RTX 4090 Grafikkarte, und die Kombination ist einfach unschlagbar. Ich kann Cyberpunk 2077 auf Ultra-Grafikeinstellungen spielen, ohne jegliche Probleme mit Bottlenecks oder Rucklern. Die Leistung ist einfach beeindruckend, und ich kann alle meine Lieblingsspiele in h√∂chster Qualit√§t genie√üen. Ich kann den Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-13900K jedem Gaming-Enthusiasten empfehlen, der auf der Suche nach herausragender Leistung und Stabilit√§t f√ºr sein Gaming-Erlebnis ist.

It adds more cores, larger cache, much faster memory and sky high frequencies. Really great multi-core scores and the performance results in gaming are fantastic which make the 13900K the world‚Äôs best gaming processor. The 13900k I am using produces an ""ok"" SP score of 99 on the ASUS Z790 Extreme but that doesn't mean it doesnt clock great . In my case just using AI tuning, the ""out of the box"" clocks I got were 6100ghz with 1.390v stable (both of these numbers will improve with custom overclocking). The temps are 34-39c idle and a max gaming temp in the area of 58-64c, those temps are with a Lian-Li Galahad 360 AIO cooler and TG kryonaut Extreme thermal paste. Total power consumption in every day usage and gaming never exceed 130 watt and total system power draw (Including a 4090) in everyday usage is around 140-145 watt (picture included on power supply maximum draw)."
252,Zugidor,Reviewed in Germany on 18 March 2023,5,"Best high end CPU for the money (as of time of writing this review, the 7950X3D is more expensive, not as widely available, and has strange gimmicks with Xbox Game Bar, so I avoided it). Despite all the news of it running extremely hot and hitting 300W, you can actually change this in your BIOS. On my Asus board, the default setting boosts it to ~310W for a short while causing 102¬∞C on my 360mm Arctic AIO before dropping to something more reasonable. YOU CAN DISABLE THIS and enforce Intel stock 250W limits. Doing this led to no throttling and no crazy 100¬∞C moments. This is not an inferno of a chip, your motherboard makes it one, so carefully check your BIOS settings if that bothers you! I'm happy that this chip does phenomenally in gaming and productivity both, so I can easily recommend it. (also, the packaging is pretty cool)"

306,Patrick,Reviewed in the United States on 22 April 2023,5,"Best investment I ever made when it comes to a gaming/streaming pc. I‚Äôm a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Now, this review isn‚Äôt about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you‚Äôre only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc‚Ä¶. Then this is the right cpu for you. I‚Äôm able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I‚Äôm able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn‚Äôt break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn‚Äôt work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn‚Äôt an issue BUT sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that‚Äôs what ddr5 has done for me. I‚Äôve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I‚Äôve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn‚Äôt disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more. Hope this review helps anybody who is on the edge about getting this or something else."

312,Nick B,Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2022,5,"Cinebench R23 scores: 40,345 MT / 2,284 ST Upgrading from the Ryzen 5950X, this processor has some significant uplift, particularly in the single-core speed. Minimal overclocking headroom as Intel has already milked 90% of the performance on stock settings. However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance. Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance. Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting. On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money."
313,s,Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2022,5,"i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‚Äòve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn‚Äôt justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu. my use case is productivity. i‚Äôm a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It‚Äôs pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable. Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it‚Äôs fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30‚Äôs. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right. About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5. Price: For 570 it‚Äôs decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700. I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade. Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don‚Äôt worry about the vrm. that‚Äôs also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get."

320,Customer 2023,Reviewed in the United States on 6 April 2023,5,"It's fast, and works better than my space heater for keeping the desk undersides warm. Too warm, really. UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense. When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast. As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast. I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case. In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes. Has to be stressing the silicon and lead to more thermal stress failures."

However, this 13900ks is a lot snappier even browsing around in windows 11. Programs launch faster and games are buttery smooth @ 4k ultra details, when paired with an Nvidia 4090. I also love the fact that the ks is a ‚Äúbinned‚Äù CPU, which overclocks more easily and typically handles faster DDR5 memory in the range of 7800-8400Mhz depending on how good the memory controller is in your 13900ks sample. Regardless, you will probably be able to hit 7800-8000 at the least. This purchase is actually my 2nd 13900ks and I ended up getting a better binned version this time. With an overal(Asus) SP of 113, P Cores 123, e cores 93, and memory controller was 83. Im currently running a G.Skill 32GB(2x16GB) 7800mhz DDR5 kit with XMP turned on in the BIOS. I have been able to bump it up to a stable 8000mhz by bumping up the Memory Controller voltage to 1.4v and the VDD/VDDQ voltage to 1.5v using the same timings that were on my 7800 XMP kit CL36. With the CPU and a Corsair h170i 420mm AIO with 6 fans in a push pull configuration, I was able to get a stable CPU overclock of 60/60/58/58/58/58/58/58 on the (8) P cores, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I can bump the 1-3 core workloads higher. It‚Äôs when using a workload that requires all 8 P cores that I run into some stability issues with my current cooling trying to push it past 5.8Ghz using all 8 p cores. I leave my E cores all synced at 4.3Ghz stock to help give me more P core Overclock headroom. Another overclock method that works really well, is easy and stable, is to turn on the Asus AiOverclock. Given that I have used both an MSI and Asus Z790 motherboard, I highly recommend the Asus ROG brand line for a Z790 compatible motherboard for this 13900ks. They update their BIOS version frequently and there quality is typically very good on there products that are produced in higher numbers. The absolute ideal motherboard for Overclocking and using the fastest DDR5 ram would be the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX(2-DIMM) motherboard. If you just can‚Äôt get your hands on one maybe go with the (4-DIMM) Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero motherboard. You should be able to reach up to 7600mhz DDR5 on it. Whatever you do don‚Äôt settle on a motherboard, because it‚Äôs the center of the system and can be upgraded later. I started with an MSI Meg Z790 Ace and wish I had started with an Asus. The MSI ran a lot hotter with the same clock speeds and only supported up to 7200mhz DDR5 using 2x16GB sticks. The motherboard attached in the review photo is the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX, a thermal Grizzly 12/13th gen contact frame to make the cpu more level for the heatsink cooler that goes on top and of course the 13900ks that‚Äôs a little dirty from previously applied thermal paste I just wiped off. Sorry for the long winded review, but this has been my favorite CPU that I‚Äôve owned.  It‚Äôs super fast and you can tinker with it for an easy overclock for fun."

353,Colloquialism,Reviewed in the United States on 2 August 2023,5,"At the time of this review, this is the top of the line for gaming CPU‚Äôs. The first ever chip to hit 6.0Ghz out of the box. It‚Äôs amazing. I have no trouble with anything running or processing on this. Paired with 128GB of ram and a 4090, you can conquer any game or task that the average person could ever need. If you can get one, do it! Just avoid the inflated prices though."

356,T. Cooper,Reviewed in the United States on 24 October 2023,5,"I upgraded from a 12900K to this 13900KS.  Some might say the performance gain is minimal...10%-20% FPS at best.  To me, those numbers are huge.  Weather they are accurate or not I can't say as I am not into this hobby like that.  What I can say is this, I have noticed a massive difference.  Especially when running cinebench or 3D Mark.  I paired this with Strix 4090 OC, Strix Z790-E and a crucial T700 Gen 5 SSD and the performance is amazing."
357,Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 24 April 2023,5,"Works just fine, really fast, lots of cores.  With all the cores running, they will run up to 100 C and throttle back on clock speed with pretty much any standard CPU cooler.  The consensus seems to be that this is limited by the thermal connection inside the CPU case between the actual chip and the upper surface which contacts your cooling block.  In other words, the cores can overheat even if your cooling system can maintain the upper surface of the CPU at room temperature.  You don't want the cores running hot at 99 C for any length of time, and so you really need to tune the CPU clock speed and the voltages with a motherboard that permits overclock tuning.  With a good standard CPU cooler, I found it's possible to run continuously with a 4.7 GHz clock on all 24 cores and keep the core temperatures below 85 C."
